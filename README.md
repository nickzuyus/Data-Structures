# Data-Structures

### Project 1
This project is an implementation of various data structures and algorithms, completed as part of the Data Structures course (CS 2413) during the Spring 2023 semester. The code showcases my understanding and application of fundamental data structure operations, such as insertion, removal, searching, and sorting. The main function reads input from a file, processes dynamic arrays A and B, and demonstrates various operations such as insertion, searching, summation, and removal. The code then prints the results of these operations, showcasing the updated state of the arrays after each modification.

### Project 2
In this project, I implemented a class in C++ to manage a 2D table of string values with various functionalities including reading from a CSV file, displaying the table, sorting rows, and searching for specific records and values. The tableClass encapsulates the table data and provides methods for file reading, displaying, sorting, and searching the table. It also includes additional methods to retrieve subsets of rows and columns, and to determine the minimum value in a column of numerical data.

While working on this project, I learned how to effectively use dynamic memory allocation for 2D arrays in C++ and handle file I/O operations. I also improved my understanding of operator overloading, especially for accessing elements in a custom class, and gained experience in parsing CSV files and managing string operations. Additionally, I explored different search and sorting algorithms, reinforcing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms in practical applications.

### Project 3
In this project, I developed a C++ program that simulates a blockchain system. The project involves creating classes for transactions, blocks, and the blockchain itself. Each transaction includes details like transaction ID, source ID, target ID, amount, and timestamp. Blocks contain a fixed number of transactions and are linked together to form a blockchain. The program reads transactions from an input file, organizes them into blocks, and ensures that new blocks are created when the current block reaches its maximum transaction capacity. This simulates the process of adding transactions to a blockchain and provides functionality for displaying the transactions and blocks.

Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how blockchain technology works at a fundamental level. I learned about managing dynamic data structures such as vectors and linked lists to store and manipulate transactions and blocks. The project also enhanced my skills in object-oriented programming, particularly in designing and implementing classes with constructors, methods, and data encapsulation. Additionally, I improved my ability to handle file input and output operations and practiced writing efficient code for inserting and retrieving data from complex data structures.

### Project 4
In Project 4 for my CS 2413 Data Structures course, I implemented a blockchain network simulation in C++. The project involved classes for transactions, blocks, blockchains, and a network of nodes. The transaction class managed transaction details and participant balances, while the block class handled transactions within blocks and included search capabilities. The blockChain class managed a linked list of blocks, dynamically creating new blocks as needed. The blockNetwork class orchestrated interactions between nodes, facilitating transaction insertion and blockchain exchange. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of blockchain principles, honed skills in data structure management, and practiced effective object-oriented programming techniques in a simulated decentralized environment.

### Project 5
In Project 5 for my CS 2413 Data Structures course, I developed a program in C++ to convert a flowchart representation into executable code. The project utilized classes such as Node to encapsulate details about nodes in the flowchart, including node number, type (e.g., START, END, IF, BLOCK), and optional text content. The convertFlowChart function processed the flowchart using an adjacency list, interpreting each node type to generate corresponding code segments. This project enhanced my understanding of graph traversal algorithms and reinforced skills in handling data structures and algorithmic logic within a programmatic context.

### Project 6
In Project 6 for my CS 2413 Data Structures course, I implemented a program in C++ that utilizes maps and unordered maps to manage data read from a file. The project involved creating a hash function hashStr to determine positions within these data structures based on string inputs, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. The main function read operations from a specified file, executing commands to insert or remove entries dynamically into both a map and an unordered_map. Each data structure was displayed sequentially using custom display functions, showcasing the stored data organized by their hash positions. This project enhanced my proficiency in utilizing associative containers and reinforced concepts related to hashing and efficient data retrieval in C++ programming contexts.
