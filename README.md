# Data-Structures

## Project 1
This project is an implementation of various data structures and algorithms, completed as part of the Data Structures course (CS 2413) during the Spring 2023 semester. The code showcases my understanding and application of fundamental data structure operations, such as insertion, removal, searching, and sorting. The main function reads input from a file, processes dynamic arrays A and B, and demonstrates various operations such as insertion, searching, summation, and removal. The code then prints the results of these operations, showcasing the updated state of the arrays after each modification.
